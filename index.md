# How vaccines work

> Vaccines work by stimulating our immune system to produce antibodies without actually infecting us with the disease. [^nhs-how]

There are two types of immunity [^nhs-how]:

- *Active immunity* is when a body generates its own antibodies.
- *Passive immunity* is when antibodies are given to a body (such as mother passing antibodies to a newborn baby).
